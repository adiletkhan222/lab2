 <p>Sorry seems to be the hardest word</p>
 <p>What I got to do</p>
 <p>To make you love me?</p>
 <p>What I got to do</p>
 <p>To make you care?</p>
 <p>What do I do</p>
 <p>When lightning strikes me?</p>
 <p>And I wake to find<p>That you're not there?</p>
 <p>What I got to do</p>
 <p>To make you want me?</p
 <p>What I got to do</p>
 <p>To be heard?</p>
 <p>What do I say when it's all over, babe?</p>
 <p>Sorry seems to be the hardest word (that's right)</p>
 <p>It's sad, so sad</p>
 <p>It's a sad, sad situation</p>
 <p>And it's getting more</p>
 <p>And more absurd</p>
 <p>It's sad, so sad</p>
 <p>Why can't we talk it over?</p>
 <p>Oh, it seems to me</p>
 <p>That sorry seems to be</p>
 <p>The hardest word</p>
 <p>What do I do</p>
 <p>To make you want me?</p>
 <p>What I got to do</p>
 <p>To be heard?</p>

 <p>Oh, it seems to me (yo, yo)</p>
 <p>Sorry seems to be the hardest word</p>
 <p>Sorry!</p>
 <p>What do I do</p>
 <p>To make you love me?</p>
 <p>What I got to do</p>
 <p>To be heard?</p>
 <p>What do I do</p>
 <p>When lightning strikes me? Yeah</p>
 <p>What have I got to do?</p>
 <p>What have I got to do?</p>
